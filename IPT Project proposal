So We  are creating an audio playing software using .Net Application. Because creating Management software are just too conventional. The main motive to do this project is to learn how to do streaming either it is audio  or video. And if we succeed in this we will also implement it with video streaming too and will create a replica of youtube and will provide APIs inform integrated with Iframes then. Just like a Spotify/Sound cloud replica but with better functionalities and implementing new ideas.
